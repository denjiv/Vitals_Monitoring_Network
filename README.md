# Vitals Monitoring Network

# INTRODUCTION 
Vitals Beaconing System (VBS) offers the healthcare professionals and home nurses an inexpensive and wireless way of monitoring vitals of multiple people in close (20-100 meter) proximity. VBS is capable of measuring heart rate, temperature, and acceleration of a person wearing the device. This information is sent over the BLE advertising channels with a purpose to distribute such information to all relevant devices that are listening. A node device is also available to prolong the distance of the message by 20 more meters. The goal of this project is to develop a prototype of a VBS and its additional node. The system is attached to a pair of glasses and wakes up when the device is picked up. In order to achieve this, a Nordic Semiconductor NRF52832 breakout board is used with a heart rate sensor, infrared temperature sensor, and an accelerometer connected. The chip is programmed using the C programming language. After the data is collected, parsed, and sent, it can be read by an on-board server that reads the advertisement data and displays it accordingly on a website hosted on the local Wifi network.   The project was designed following a full development cycle, including UML and Gantt chart for planning. The initial tests examine the hardware functionality of the sensors and the development board. The second set of tests included basic functionality of the BLE advertisement and scanning on both the development board and the on-board computer. The final round of testing included the functionality of the final prototype of the Vitals Monitoring system in conjunction with a node that resends the advertisements through to prolong the distance of the message transfer. The final result of this project is an inexpensive way to wirelessly monitor the vitals of multiple people in a vicinity of a house or a hospital. In the future design changes  improvements can be made with inclusion of additional sensors and features.
